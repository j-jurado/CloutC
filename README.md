### How does Clout C Work?
Most people think that follower count is equivalent to popularity. However, we believe that follower count is useless without also measuring engagement. This is why Clout C uses an algorithm that takes into consideration likes to followers and retweets to followers ratios in combination with tweet count when calculating the final score. This results in a popularity score that is more holistic of a profile's overall popularity.
